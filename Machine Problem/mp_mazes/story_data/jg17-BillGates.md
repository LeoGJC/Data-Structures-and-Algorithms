Bill Gates was born in Seattle, Washington, on October 28, 1955. At 13, he enrolled in the private Lakeside prep school, and he wrote his first software program. When he was in the eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a General Electric (GE) computer for the students. Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC, and he was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine, an implementation of tic-tac-toe which allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly. He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT) and enrolled at UIUC in the autumn of 1973. He was interested in three majors, which are Computer Science, Economy, and Law. He would like to choose one from these three majors.
